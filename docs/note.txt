	* Patient *
	-----------

	* Cash * 
	--------
	(!) - Please, review the mockups

			- Incorrect field: Type:
					- None: the item has still not been charged					
					- Money: The item is charged by money

			- The amendment bill number should be auto generated like AB-0000001, AB-0000002, ... This number is unique and consecutive without gaps.
